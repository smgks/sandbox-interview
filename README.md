Flutter sandbox
===============

Using [flutter_webrtc] library create an application for audio/video calls between two users.

Application should work on Android platform.

[Design](https://www.figma.com/file/j1nINtY8l2wAaO8VeYeAJV/Flutter-Sandbox)
| [Prototype](https://www.figma.com/proto/j1nINtY8l2wAaO8VeYeAJV/Flutter-Sandbox)

> This is a [GitHub template][9] repository, so you need to click on `Use this template` button above and do all the development in your own repository which uses this one as template only.




## Required features

1. Display video and play audio of a partner participant.
2. Publish video from the frontal camera of a device.
3. Publishing user's audio.
4. Preview of the published video.
5. Ability to enable/disabled published video/audio.




## Implementation requirements

1. Code should be documented with [dartdoc] and the generated documentation should be available on GitHub Pages.
2. Code should be covered with unit tests.
3. [E2E (end-to-end) tests][3] should cover all the required features.




## [WebRTC signaling][1] server

For [signaling][1] between clients you may use simple WebSocket server provided within this project (or write your own). Messages sent to this server, will be broadcast to the all _other_ clients connected to the same server without any changes. It's up to you to define the format of messages.


### Deploying on [Heroku]

1. Create account on [Heroku] (if you don't have one).
2. Copy [Heroku] API key from the [account page][4].
3. Go to [Actions Secrets][5] settings in your GitHub repository.
4. Add the following repository keys:
    - `HEROKU_API_KEY` - API key which you copied at step 2;
    - `HEROKU_EMAIL` - email with which you registered on [Heroku].
5. Go to ['Deploy signaling server to Heroku'][6] GitHub workflow.
6. Run workflow on `master` branch.

Now your instance of a signaling server can be accessed at `wss://flutter-sandbox-{{ YOUR GITHUB USERNAME }}.herokuapp.com`.


### Example of interaction with server

1. Alice initiates a WebSocket connection on `wss://flutter-sandbox-ferris.herokuapp.com` endpoint.
2. Bob initiates a WebSocket connection on `wss://flutter-sandbox-ferris.herokuapp.com` endpoint.
3. Alice sends message with text `Hello Bob`.
4. Bob receives message with text `Hello Bob`.
5. Bob sends message with text `Hello Alice`.
6. Alice receives message with text `Hello Alice`.




## [ICE] servers

Use `stun:stun.stunprotocol.org:3478` and `stun:stun.l.google.com:19302` as [ICE] servers in your application.




## Releasing

To release your application run `make release` command.

Or you can do it manually:

```bash
$ git tag -d latest
$ git tag latest
$ git push origin latest --force 
```

CI will build your application and create a release on GitHub with `.apk` built automatically.




## Final demonstration

Once you finish the development, release the application to GitHub as described in the previous section.

Firstly, you should demonstrate that application can make calls between devices and disabling/enabling audio/video works correctly.

At the end, your application should be able to make video call with a reviewer.

Please, before demonstration make sure that your [Heroku] instance is not [sleeping][10].




## Required assets

All the assets required for this application are located in the `assets/` directory.




## Final design of application

Final design of the implemented application may vary from the provided one. The provided design aims only to explain the expected result better.

## Repository requirements


### Files

Repository __must NOT contain__ (so have them [Git-ignored] to avoid accidents):
- __configuration__ files __of__ developer's __local toolchain__ (unless this configuration is suitable for all project developers);
- __compilation/build results/artifacts__ of source code;
- any __caches or temporary files__;
- __configuration__ files __for running__ application (except examples or Dockerized development environment configurations which are the same for all project developers).

__For keeping an empty directory__ in a repository __use the `.gitkeep` file__ inside that directory.

#### Naming

__Start directory with `.`__ if it contains some __temporary files which do not require direct manipulations__ and are going to be omitted by tools (caches, temp files, etc.). This is a quite common practice (see `.git/`, `.idea/`, `.gradle/`, etc.).  
Also, __all temporary cache files__ must be __placed inside a `.cache/`__ top-level directory of the repository, unless this is impossible for somewhat reasons.

__To emphasize toolchain directories__ (ones which do not contain project sources itself, but rather contain files of a project toolchain) their __name may be started with `_`__, which will make them to "bubble-up" in a repository source tree, so will allow easily to distinguish them from actual project sources (both for humans and tools).


### Branches and tags

Every repository contains the following branches:

- `master` - __mainline version__ of the project. Any new project release is usually created from this branch. Developing directly in this branch is forbidden. It __accepts new changes via PRs (pull requests)__.

Any other possible branches and tags can be created and used by developers as they need.

#### Branch naming

[Git] branch name __must__ meet the following requirements:
- consist of __English words__;  
    üëç `fix-tests-failure`  
    üö´ `fix-defectum-probat`
- use __only dashes to separate words__;  
    üëç `fix-tests-failure`  
    üö´ `fix_tests_failure`
- use __[imperative mood][2] for verbs__;  
    üëç `fix-tests-failure`  
    üö´ `fixes-tests-failure`
- __start with the issue number__ when branch is related to some issue (but __DO NOT use PR (pull request) numbers__);  
    üëç `23-fix-tests-failure`  
    üö´ `fix-tests-failure`
- __reflect the meaning of branch changes__, not the initial problem.    
    üëç `23-fix-tests-failure`  
    üö´ `23-problem-with-failing-tests`


### Commits

Every __commit message must contain a short description__ of its changes that meet the following requirements:
- be __on English__ (no other language is allowed);
- __start with a capital letter__;
- has __no punctuation symbols at the end__ (like `;`, `:` or `.`);
- use __[imperative mood][2] for verbs__ (as if you are commanding someone: `Fix`, `Add`, `Change` instead of `Fixes`, `Added`, `Changing`);
- use __marked list for multiple changes__, prepended by __one summary line__ and __one blank line__, where each __list item__ must:
    - __start with a lowercase letter__;
    - has __no punctuation symbols at the end__.

##### üëç Single-line commit message example

```
Update Employee salary algorithm
```

##### üëç Multiple-line commit message example

```
Implement employees salary and ajax queries

- update Employee salary algorithm
- remove unused files from public/images/ dir
- implement ajax queries for /settings page
```

##### üö´ Wrong commit message examples

- Summary line starts with a lowercase letter:

    ```
    update Employee salary algorithm
    ```

- Verb is not in the [imperative mood][2]:

    ```
    Updates Employee salary algorithm
    ```

- Unnecessary punctuation is present:

    ```
    Update Employee salary algorithm.
    ```

    ```
    Implement employees salary and ajax queries:
    
    - update Employee salary algorithm;
    - remove unused files from public/images/ dir.
    ```

- Missing blank line between the summary line and the marked list:

    ```
    Implement employees salary and ajax queries
    - update Employee salary algorithm
    - remove unused files from public/images/ dir
    ```

- Marked list is indented:

    ```
    Implement employees salary and ajax queries
    
      - update Employee salary algorithm
      - remove unused files from public/images/ dir
    ```

- Marked list items start with a capital letter:

    ```
    Implement employees salary and ajax queries
    
    - Update Employee salary algorithm
    - Remove unused files from public/images/ dir
    ```


### FCM (final commit message)

FCM (final commit message) is a commit message of a pull request to a `master` branch.

As it will be saved in a repository history forever, it has __extra requirements__ that __must__ be met:
- __contain references__ to related PR;
- do __not contain__ any non-relative helper markers (like `[skip ci]`);

__Common commit messages__ which are not FCM __must NOT contain any references__, because references create crosslinks in mentioned PRs, which leads to spamming issues/PRs with unnecessary information. Only saved in history forever commits are allowed to create such crosslinks.

If –∞ PR contains some __side changes__ which are not directly relevant to the task, then such changes __must be described as a marked list in the `Additionally:` section (separated by a blank line)__ of a FCM.

##### üëç FCM examples

```
Implement employees salary and ajax queries (#43, #54)

- update Employee salary algorithm
- remove unused files from public/images/ dir

Additionally:
- update Git ignoring rules for TOML files
```

##### üö´ Wrong FCM examples

- Bad formatting of [references][103]:

    ```
    Implement employees salary and ajax queries(#43,#54)

    - update Employee salary algorithm
    - remove unused files from public/images/ dir
    ```

- Side changes are not separated:

    ```
    Implement employees salary and ajax queries (#43, #54)

    - update Employee salary algorithm
    - remove unused files from public/images/ dir
    - update Git ignoring rules for TOML files
    ```

- Bad formatting of side changes:

    ```
    Implement employees salary and ajax queries (#43, #54)

    - update Employee salary algorithm
    - remove unused files from public/images/ dir
    Additionally:
    - update Git ignoring rules for TOML files
    ```


### Merging

__All merges to the mainline__ project version (`master` branch) __must have an individual PR (pull request)__ and must be __done only in [fast-forward] manner__. This is required to keep mainline history linear, simple and clear.

To achieve [fast-forward merge][fast-forward], __all branch commits__ (which doesn't exist in mainline) __must be squashed and rebased onto the latest mainline commit__. Notable moments are:
- Before rebase __do not forget to merge your branch with latest mainline branch updates__, otherwise rebase result can break changes.

#### Squash merging steps

##### Using GitHub UI

Performing squash merge correctly can be quite tricky when doing manually. To avoid complexity and mistakes in a day-to-day routine the [GitHub UI squash merging][13] is the __most preferred way__ for merging and a __developer should use it whenever it's possible__.

0. Merge with latest `master` branch.

1. Click on `Squash and merge` button.

2. Paste first line of FCM to title field.

3. Paste FCM without first line to body field.

4. Click `Confirm squash and merge`.

- __First line__ of FCM must go __as a title__ of the squash commit and __everything after as a message__.

Squash merging via GitHub UI also preserves the whole branch commits history in the PR, which is good for history purposes.


### Pushing

Developer __must push all his changes__ to the remote __at the end of his working day__. This both prevents from accidental work losses and helps a lead to track developer's progress.




## Project requirements

All features of application should be added with PRs. __Direct push to `master` is forbidden.__


### Pull requests

PRs (pull requests) are created to make changes in the repository and to solve some problem (fix a bug, implement a task, provide an improvement, etc).

PR __must contain related changes only__. Any __other unrelated changes__ of repository must be done __via separate PR__. This rule keeps project history clear and unambiguous.

PR __name must__:
- __shortly and clearly describe its meaning__;
- __contain `Draft: ` prefix__ until PR is merged or closed.

Not merged or closed PRs should be in [draft mode][11].

PR __description must contain details of the solution__ (background/summary, solution description, notable moments, etc).

Project have [PR template][12] which standardize PRs. Developer must __use [PR template][12] whenever it's possible__.  
If there is no template for some rare case, then the PR must be formatted in the same manner as available templates.

PR cannot be assigned to nobody and __always must have an assigned developer__.

PR cannot go without any labels and __must have all required labels correctly applied__.


### Labels

Labels are used for issues/PRs classification, as they:
- reflect the current state of issue/PR;
- improve understanding of issue/PR, its purpose and application;
- provide advanced search of issues/PRs;
- allow to sum up statistics of how project is going on.

There are several label groups:
- Type labels declare what the current issue/PR actually represents. These labels are __mandatory__: each issue/PR must have at least one such label.
    - `feature` applies when something new is implemented (or is going to be implemented).
    - `enhancement` applies when changing of existing features is involved (improvement or bugfix).
    - `rollback` applies when some existing changes are going to be rolled back.
- `k::` labels describe what the current issue/PR is relevant to and which project aspects are involved. These labels are __mandatory__: each issue/PR must have at least one such label.
    - `k::ui` applies to UI (user interface) and UX (user experience) changes. Use it when end-user are directly affected by this changes.
    - `k::api` applies to API (application interface) changes. Use it when you're changing application interfaces, like: HTTP API method parameters, library exported interfaces, command-line interfaces, etc.
    - `k::deploy` applies to changes that involve application deployment. Use it when you're changing the way application is deployed.
    - `k::design` applies to changes of application architecture and implementation design. Use it when you're changing architecture and algorithms.
    - `k::documentation` applies to changes of project documentation.
    - `k::logging` applies to changes in application logs.
    - `k::performance` applies to application performance related changes.
    - `k::refactor` applies to refactor changes of existing code.
    - `k::security` applies to application security related changes.
    - `k::testing` applies to changes of project tests.
    - `k::toolchain` applies to changes of project toolchain.




## Code style

All Dart source code must follow [Effective Dart] official recommendations. For code formatting [dartfmt] must be used (and verified on CI).


### `.editorconfig` rules

Project contains [`.editorconfig` file][7] with both general and project-specific code style rules.

__Applying `.editorconfig` rules is mandatory.__

Make sure that your IDE supports `.editorconfig` rules applying. For JetBrains IDE the [EditorConfig plugin][8] may be used.
